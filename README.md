[00:04.49] Do you think about the days when we sat down
[00:07.60] Smoking, wine and drinking haze? Or
[00:11.81] Was it the other way?
[00:15.02] Was it the other way?
[00:25.52] 
[00:17.83] Do you think about the days when we sat down
[00:21.70] Smoking, wine and drinking haze? Or
[00:25.59] Was it the other way?
[00:29.16] Was it the other way?
[00:39.66] 
[00:31.96] Swing 'round, come and chill with me
[00:34.14] I got your favorite show recorded on my TV
[00:37.71] But we don't have to watch that, no
[00:42.27] I'll turn off the radio
[00:53.77] 
[00:44.61] So won't you pick up?
[00:46.22] Then we can link up
[00:47.84] It's not a hookup
[00:49.74] Don't think about it too much, too much
[00:52.91] You just need to pick up
[00:54.95] Then we can link up
[00:56.68] Don't think about it too much, too much
